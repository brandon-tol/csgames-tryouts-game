# CSGAMES-Tryouts-2DP

This is a simple 2d game using unity's paper2d and sprite systems. You are free to modify it in any way you like for this challenge.
If you are newer to Unreal and want some goals to focus on here they are :
 * change the player sprite.
 * change the level and add new terrain to the tilemap/implement it in the tileset.
 * change the player's speed, acceleration, jump height.
 * Implement a death/respawn mechanic.
